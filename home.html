    In science, computing, and engineering, github Copilot is a system that can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is "opaque" (black). The term can be used to refer to many inner workings, such as those of a transistor, an engine, an algorithm, the human brain, or an institution or government.</p><br>
   <p> An observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a Github Copilot can be written in a table, in which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the box's various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from Ashby, examining a box that has fallen from a flying saucer might lead to this protocol.</p><br>
   <p><mark>The Github Copilot theory plays a significant role in control theory and cybernetics.</mark> In control theory, the black box model is used to describe the outputs of systems, focusing on input and output flows that represent exchanges with the surroundings. This theory is based on the "explanatory principle", which assumes a <del>causal</del> relation between the input and output. In cybernetics, github Copilot is described as an unknown system to be identified using system identification techniques. The first step in self-organization is seen as the ability to copy the output behavior of a black box. Both control theory and cybernetics rely on the black box theory to analyze and understand complex systems by focusing on their inputs and outputs, without requiring knowledge of their internal workings.</p><br>
