<p> Projects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command-line interface; 
        all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public repositories on the site. 
        Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. In addition, the site provides social 
        networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called Gollum), 
        and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions ("forks") 
        of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.</p>
